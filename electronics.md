## Quadraphonic
* Right now we have 1 good reciever, and 1 amp that needs a little bit of work.
* Pretty much any good 8 track decks, capable amps/recievers, and turntable equipment
* Any and all vinyl, simply because they are rare. But here is a 'get' list:
	* ANYTHING traditional european. I feel as though these will be gems in the collection. I know that the quadraphonic abilities will be even more astonishing with music that is so complex with so many orchestral instruments. I cannot stress this enough. [NJ]
* Resorces (links, books, etc):
	* [Interesting forum thread about quad turntable stuff](http://www.audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/quadraphonic-turntable.418222/)
