## Quadraphonic
* Right now we have 1 good reciever, and 1 amp that needs a little bit of work. Also the Akai 8 track quad deck

* 8 TRACK get list:
	* BTO II
	* BTO - Not Fragile
	* Grand Funk Railroad - Shine On

* VINYL get list:
	* ANYTHING traditional european. I feel as though these will be gems in the collection. I know that the quadraphonic abilities will be even more astonishing with music that is so complex with so many orchestral instruments. I cannot stress this enough. [NJ]
